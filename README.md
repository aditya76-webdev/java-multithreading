This readme file will keep a record for me like what are the things that are remaining to code and what are concepts still left.
1). executor service and callable.
-->future execution and callable interface.
2). synchronized method and synchronized block
3). merge sort using multithreading
4). adder and subtractor problem and its solution using synchronized, mutex , locks , atomic data types, semaphores.
5). producer consumer problem and its soultion using synchronized, mutex , locks and atomic data types and semaphores. 
6). all types of solution to synchronization like atomic Integer, locks, mutex , semaphores , synchronized blocks and synchronized methods. 
7). threads methods like sleep, yield , notify, isAlive, getName, setPriority, getPriority.
8). Concurrent DataStructures like LinkedHashMap


Done till now...
1). Ways of creating threads. a). by extending thread class b). by implementing runnable interface.
2). threads methods sleep, yield, notify, isAlive , getName , setPriority, getPriority.
